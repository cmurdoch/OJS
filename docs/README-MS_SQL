	=================================
	=== Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL)
	=================================



--------------
PDO SQL Server
--------------

1. Open the link "https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/releases" in a Web browser.
2. According to the installed PHP version, download the DLL package for Microsoft SQL Server.
3. Rename the PDO file to "php_pdo_sqlsrv.dll".
4. Add this file to the "ext" folder in the PHP installation.



------------------------------------
Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server
------------------------------------

Depending on which PHP version is used, download the according ODBC driver to make the connection viable.

The ODBC 11 is required for PHP version "5.6.35". This PHP version must use an old version of the SQL Server PDO.



-----
ADOdb
-----

The ADOdb version has been modified to "5.20.12" and this version has been further more customized
to take in charge MS SQL.

The modified version is available in the folder "docs/dev" in the file "adodb_ms_sql.zip".

Extract it somewhere and replace the current ADOdb found in the following folder : "ojs\lib\pkp\lib\adodb".

This procedure is temporary and far from optimal. All the modifications should be integrated directly to
the latest ADOdb version. At this point, we could change the version number in OJS.



------------------
Configuration File
------------------

ms_sql = On
driver = pdo_sqlsrv
host = sqlsrv:server=SERVER\\INSTANCE

Note: within the setup home page, if an instance is required, only put one backslash in the host section.
