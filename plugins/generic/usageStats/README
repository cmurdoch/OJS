Data Privacy Option
--------------------
This option will hash the logged IP adresses using a randomly generated salt that will be daily changed.
The salt is randomly generated either using:
- the funciton mcrypt_create_iv, which requires the PHP mcrypt
- the function openssl_random_pseudo_bytes, which requires the PHP openssl
- the file /dev/urandom, which works only on *nix systems
- the function mt_rand, which is not cryptographicaly safe.
Thus, if you are using a Windows server, please ensure that you install either the PHP mcrypt or openssl, 
in order to have the cryptographicaly safe generated salt.
